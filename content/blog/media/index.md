## Creating Your Own Custom ROS Artwork

We encourage all members of the ROS community to create custom illustrations for their ROS packages, releases, and events. Before creating your artwork please carefully consider the Trademark Rules and Guidelines outlined above. If you are unsure if you illustration requires approval we encourage you to message us at info@openrobotics.org to discuss the matter. The community is welcome to comission our current project illustrator [Ryan Hungerford](https://www.behance.net/ryetoons9ee0?locale=en_US) for custom work or use their own local illustrator. 

The ROS project has had a long and and valuable relationship with professional illustrators since the early days of the project. We credit these illustrators' work with creating our strong brand identity. As such we discourage the use of AI / generative art for ROS related artwork.
