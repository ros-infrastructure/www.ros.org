### TurtleBot

TurtleBot is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. TurtleBot was created at Willow Garage
by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in November 2010. With TurtleBot, you’ll be able to build a robot that can
drive around your house, see in 3D, and have enough horsepower to create exciting applications. For more
information, we recommend an interview with TurtleBot creators, Tully Foote and Melonee Wise.

### TurtleBot3

TurtleBot3 is a new generation mobile robot that is modular, compact and customizable. Let’s explore ROS and
create exciting applications for education, research and product development. The goal of TurtleBot3 is to
drastically reduce the size and lower the price of the platform without sacrificing capability, functionality,
and quality. Optional parts such as chassis, computers and sensors are available, and TurtleBot3 can be
customized in various ways. TurtleBot3 is willing to be in the center of the maker movement by applying the
latest technical advances of the SBC (Single Board Computer), the Depth sensor and 3D printing technology.
